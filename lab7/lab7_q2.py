'''
Write Python code to find the cost of the minimum-energy seam in a list of lists.

energies = [[24,      22,      30,      15,      18,      19],
            [12,      23,      15,      23,      10,     15],
            [11,      13,      22,      13,      21,      14],
            [13,      15,      17,      28,      19,      21],
            [17,      17,      7,       27,      20,      19]]
     
    The correct output for the given energies data is 15+10+13+17+7 = 62.
